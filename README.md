# A reading guide for asking dev questions :information_desk_person:
Five golden rules to ask great dev questions?

 * Summary of problem inside of the title  <br/>
 * Be as clear and concise as possible defining the probem in the body  <br/>
 * Include a minimal code snippet to reproduce the problem  <br/>
 * Include a (few) tag(s)for others to find your question  <br/>
 * Proof-read your question before publication  <br/>

## Creating dev questions, stepwise

1. Check if your particular dev question is unique on stackoverflow (or elsewhere online)
2. Copy-paste a code snippet and break the issue down in 3 to 5 key words
3. Ensure that your question is as clear and specific as possible to your snippet. Add enough details about the problem to make yourself understandable and others able to reproduce the problem.
